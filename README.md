# Sales_Analysis
Here is my "Sales Analysis project" made by SQL, Power BI. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was done based on a Business case, its requirement was as following:
  1- Improving internet sales reports, and moving from static reports to        visual reports.  
  2- Focus on how much has been sold of what products, to which clients, 
     and how it has been over time.
  3- In addition, Each sales person works on differen products and 
     customers can filter them.
  4- Measure numbers againest budget, and the analysis is done by looking 
     two years back.
