Here is my "Sales Analysis project" made by SQL, Power BI. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was done based on a Business case, its requirement was as following:
  1- Improving internet sales reports, and moving from static reports to        visual reports.  
  2- Focus on how much has been sold of what products, to which clients, 
     and how it has been over time.
  3- In addition, Each sales person works on differen products and 
     customers can filter them.
  4- Measure numbers againest budget, and the analysis is done by looking 
     two years back.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, I made a user story to be sure that i have a fully understanding of the requirements:
  1- A dashboard overview of internet sales.
  2- A detailed overview of internet sales per product.
  3- A detailed overview of internet sales per customers.
  4- A dashboard overview of internet sales.
Second, I restored the database into Microsoft SQL server management studio to identfy the desired tables to do the analysis.
Then, I wrote some SQL queries on some tables to extract the required date.
After saving the result of the quiries as a  CSV files, it was loaded to power BI to be modeled and visualized.
Then, I checked if any columns needs transformation, and i made the date model.
After doing the data modeling, I created some measures to be used in the visualization.
